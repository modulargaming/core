# What is Modular Gaming?

We are in the process of creating a open source [persistent browser based web game (PBBG)](http://www.pbbg.org) framework which will have
 all the features to get you started and let you start developing your unique features without having to write all the basics.
 We have taken a modular approach, you can use only the modules you want. If you wanted just a forum you could enable only
 the core , [user](../user)
 and [forum](../forum) modules.

We are building our framework using [Kohana](http://www.kohanaframework.org) which is an open source, 
[object oriented](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php) 
[H](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)[MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
 web framework built using [PHP5](http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php) by a team of volunteers that aims to be 
swift, secure, and small. We are using [Kohana 3.3](../kohana/) with many modules, including the following:

* 1.) [ORM](../orm) is a a powerful Object Relational Mapping (ORM) module that uses the [active record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern)
 pattern and database introspection to determine a model's column information.
* 2.) [Mustache](https://github.com/bobthecow/mustache.php)
 is a template specification we use for our templates, we use the [Kostache](https://github.com/zombor/KOstache) implementation.
